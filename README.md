BigDataXmasAppathon
===================

The prize (add prizes here which you are willing to contribute)
Variable : Depends on donations.  So far 1 bottle of Caymus Cabernet (Really awesome)

Scoring
=======

Each project gets 0-1 points for each category, where each score can have one decimal point.

1) code quality is multiplied by (x^2)

2) kids handicap : for every child under 2 years old you get a .01 score boost handicap

code quality : does reading the code make you cry ?

hip factor : does watching the demo make you smile ?

*scalability*  : any non-scalable  bottlenecks? (notwithstanding any interactive/visualization part of the app which is not parallelized) 
*testability* : can it be tested without a cluster?
*maintainability* : how easy to add a new phase to the pipeline ?
*documentation* : how easy is it for someone to contribute ?

Rules
=======

Teams are okay ~ Project doesn't need to be done by indivuduals, you can compete as a team.

More Rules
==========

Project must leverage a *red hat product, fedora ecosystem packages, or upstream community with RHT engagement*
Project code must be hosted on a *here*.
Project must run *from source / README directions, entirely*.
Project must scale : *no one off scripts - even the data formatting and ETL have to be parallelized.*
Project must include a cool *visualization component.*

If using external data : End users should be able to pull it down, or generate mock data, to run the app.

Project have at least one unit test so that reviewers can do sanity check before diving in to reproduce results.

Getting Started

Put your code somewhere we can pull it down.
If not familiar with jenkins - get someone to help you set up a build for your project.
Start hacking.
Finish hacking by december 20th so you can have all your docs done by december 25th.

Judges
======

(volunteer your name here) - judges ARE allowed to vote on their own apps...

But are equally obliged to evaluate ALL other apps as well !
